# 13 ORM  E-Commerce




## Challenge Week 13

E-Commerce Back End.

## Usage
You will need to install the npm package using the following command line, then use the following command npm install, and  npm start(or node index.js).
Insomnia will be needed to run the challenge to view the API calls. 

This weeks challenge was using Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This will be the backend of the e-commerce front end. You will be able to use Insomnia with the requests GET, POST, DELETE, or POST PUT to interact with the database. 

## Reflection
THis weeks project was a demonstration of insanity for me. Setting up the folders and the database was easy enough but setting up the routes and models seem to be where the craziness started. But lots of trials and errors was able to figure it out. It is working as expected and looks to be a good example of a backend to a emommerce site. Im going to continue to rebuild more examples similar to get more experience with routes and models.
